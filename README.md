# AI-maze-odor-gradient
Project for the Artificial Intelligence course in Yachay Tech University. The main idea is that, having an inteligent agent (a rat), a maze and a goal that produces an odor around it (a cheese), that agent uses a DFS algorithm to move inside the maze and find the goal. Because the odor is spread through the entire maze (by an exponential gradient), the agent can perceive it and use it to help guide itself better through the maze. In this way, not only the agent optimizes its maze traversal (because of how DFS works), it also senses its environment and acts according to it.
